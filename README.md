The project is created to exercise with object oriented design.

In this project I've tested next principles:
1) SRP - Single Responsibility principle
2) OCP - Open Closed Principle
3) LSP - The Liskov Substitution Principle
4) ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
5) DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle

Also I've tried test driven design and tried to follow KISS, DRY Yagni principles
